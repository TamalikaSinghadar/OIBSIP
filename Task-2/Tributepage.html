            India, is ranked 3rd after US and China when it comes to the
richest persons in the country. And thanks to them as they not only generate the revenue but
also pay a lot to boost our country's economy and serve our society by funding through trust
they established. In this article, we will take a detailed look at one such personality, i.e., Ratan
Naval Tata, who has a huge impact on our country's overall development. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Who is Ratan Tata?</h2>
        <p>
            Ratan Naval Tata is presently Executive Chairman of Tata Sons, the Tata Group's parent
organization, which owns Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Motors, Tata Power, Indian Hotels,
Tata Steel, and Tata Teleservices. He was nurtured and grown-up by his grandmother when
his parents divorced while he was only ten years old, and after graduating from college, he
got actively involved in the family-owned company. In 1962, he started his job as an employee
at Tata Steel, where he learned about his family's company.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Birth</h2>
        <p>
            On December 28, 1937, Ratan Tata was born to Naval and Sonoo Tata in Bombay. Ratanji
Tata, Jamsetji Tata's younger son, adopted Naval Tata as his son. When Ratan was ten years old,
his parents divorced. His grandmother, Navajbai Tata, reared him and his half-brother, Noel
Tata.
        </p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            He went to Campion School in Bombay (then) till 8th grade, then moved to Cathedral and John
Connon Schools in Bombay and Bishop Cotton School in Shimla for further academic activities.
After finishing his academic education, in 1955, he graduated from Riverdale Country School placed in New York City. After four years at Cornell University, he earned a bachelor's
degree in architecture. He enrolled in the seven-week Advanced Management Program at
Harvard Business School in 1975, which he has been financially supporting yet.
        </p>
        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>
           He began his career as a mining worker from his own firm in 1962, which is somewhat
            stunning. Along with the other laborers, he shoveled stones and worked on the furnaces. It was
            physically difficult work, but it taught him more about his parent's business and helped him
            value it. Ratan took over as chairman of Tata Sons after J.R.D. Tata stepped down in 1991.
            Due to the freedom to operate under JRD Tata, he had to encounter significant opposition
            from the CEOs of several organizations, who proceeded to become highly strong. Although, he
            overcame all those resistance. Research, or innovation, was given a high emphasis under his
            administration, and the younger generation was handed the majority of the tasks.
            Tata Group prospered the greatest during his supervision of 21 years, with revenues rising by
            40% and profit increasing by 50%. His daring investments of major multinational
            corporations like Jaguar, Tetley & Land Rover, and Corus Steel, among others, significantly
            influenced the Indian industrial sector and the global industrial sector</p>
        <h2>Major Contribution</h2>
        <p>1. Ratan Naval Tata with his team leads to acquiring international exposure and a
            reputation for his business as Chairman of the Tata Group. Under his leadership, the firm
            also grew into a multinational company by purchasing companies such as Jaguar,
            Tetley, Land Rover, and Corus. The Tata Group was listed on the New York Stock
            Exchange due to its remarkable business success.</p>
        <p>2. He was a key figure in developing the Tata Nano and Tata Indica We can understand
            his dedication to the work that he tried to do even for the common people, as he
            introduced TATA NANO so that it could be affordable to most households.</p>
        <p>3. One of his life's main aims was to improve the quality of life for Indians while also
            advancing human growth. He is also a well-known philanthropist, with charity trusts

same business school from which Ratan Tata previously did his seven weeks Advance

            currency. Mr. Ratan Tata's entire net worth comprises a significant amount of money from
            many sources. Even though Ratan Tata is not included in the list of billionaires because charity
            organizations control 65 percent of TATA Sons, which is also the holding company for the
